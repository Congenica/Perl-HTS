# Perl-HTS
Perl XS wrapper for tabix functionality in htslib. 
This module is stable and we are using it in production, but it will no longer be developed as the tabix functionality has now been added to the much more complete https://github.com/Ensembl/Bio-HTS

To install this module:

```cpanm Bio::HTS```
